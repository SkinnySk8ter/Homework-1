      <p>Hello and welcome to my page! My name is Jody Jones and I am an aspiring computer programmer. I attended Paul Laurence Dunbar High School and Morgan State University for Music. I went on to become an Account Manager at Four Season in the downtown Baltimore area. I am originally from Salisbury, Maryland but I currently reside in Baltimore, Md. I am attending a coding bootcamp at Johns Hopkins University to learn more about the coding world and how it is making a major impact on the way we see everything and how it assists in making the world run. With the knowledge gained from this program I hope to achieve my dreams of becoming a video game software engineer and work for a company along the lines of maybe Nintendo or Sony. Thank you for taking the time to check out my profile! by using the links you should be able to find out more about me as well as some of the projects that I have completed (and currently working on). </p>

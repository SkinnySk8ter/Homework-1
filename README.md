*General Info

This is the ReadMe File for Homework assignment #1. For this assignment we were tasked with following a specific design to create a webpage to show off our future projects and to get a head start in the real world. Please note that this will be a continuous work in progress. 

 *[Assignment Details]

We were given the task of following a guideline to create an html document with a css style sheet with a few different specifications. We needed to create three different html documents (index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html) and use the style sheet to mold the pages. We were tasked with creating a header/nav bar that would scroll along with the pages. 

*[How To Setup]

The files within this document are going to be updated on a regular basis! However....there are some things to be aware of.


1.The css style sheet is located in the assets/css directory. 

2.The images are stored within the same assets/ directory but under the name "images".

3.All of the pages are linked together so feel free to click away to explore!

4.As stated before, this is a work in progress! Notes on things that have not been worked out yet are marked in green notation (or possibly another color depending on what you prefer).

5.It looks like the files are all out in the open but I assure you----all css and images documents are located in assests folder. (currently in the process of figuring out how to delete the extra files such as "portfolio")


*6.The contact page is the example page for the rest of the document!*
